#Terminology

These are some Basic Rules about the Terminology that will be used in our program

1) All drawing functions will be called "render" ( i.e. player.render() ) and will be placed in the render.js file.

2) All updating functions will be called "integrate" ( i.e. mob.integrate() ) and will be placed in the integrate.js file.

3) All classes, global variables and global objects will be placed in the variables.js file.
