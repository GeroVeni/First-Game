#Terminology

These are some Basic Rules about the Terminology that will be used in our program

1) All drawing functions will be called "render" ( i.e. player.render() ) and will be placed in the render.js file.

2) All updating functions will be called "integrate" ( i.e. mob.integrate() ) and will be placed in the integrate.js file.

3) All classes, global variables and global objects will be placed in the variables.js file.

4) All variable names that include more than one noun will be written with the first letter of each noun capital except for the first one ( i.e. thisIsAVariable and not this_is_a_variable )
